THE PSYCHIC GAME

Guess what letter the psychic is thinking of by pressing any letter on your keyboard.

You have 9 guesses to guess the right letter, but if your counter hits zero. YOU LOSE.

But if you guess the right letter, you win the game and you'll be rewarded with a song.

I included a function to include audio into my game. If you guess the right letter, and win the game the song will trigger. Once you start playing the game again the song will stop playing, and you will have to win again to hear it.

Styled my page a little with CSS. Included a background color, added font features, and an image of the "psychic".

Logic in my js file is psuedocoded, and easy to read through. 

Notes appreciated!
